# OMDB_API_UPDATED

Shape Software Developer Apprenticeship Task - UPDATED

This is my updated version of an OMDB API App in flutter.

## Introduction

I really enjoyed the task, but those 6 hours flew by, so I have decided to try and update the version I uploaded.

## UPDATED Features


### Additional "Movie Details" screen- 

- Users can now get a better look at poster and movie details, I intend to also pull a short plot from the OMDB API.

### Error Handling - 

- Added a few movie quotes rather than the basic error handling "try again" etc

### Improved UI & Logo

- New colour palette, bolder App Bar titles, more visually appealing buttons.
- New App name "Shape Movies".
- New logo matching the colour theme and fitting the brand name.
- Decided against the image carousel on the homepage

## TO DO

- Add "Plot" to Movie Details screen
- Search Filtering 
- Create a Theme.dart file to carry consistent theme data and clean up other files

## Final Notes

While still rough, I am happy with the progress I've made. Depending on sources I have been reading, there seems to be different ideas of what constitutes "best practice" so I may have missed the mark in a few areas. Most notably with theme data - it did seem strange to be applying graphical changes inside the widget trees, so I do intend to change that.

Also my comments are still a bit all over the place, but have been invaluable to me in terms of keeping track of where I am and what I still need to research.
