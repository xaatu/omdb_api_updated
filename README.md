# OMDB_API_UPDATED

Shape Software Developer Apprenticeship Task - UPDATED

This is my updated version of an OMDB API App in flutter.

## Introduction

I really enjoyed the task, but those 6 hours flew by, so I have decided to try and update the version I uploaded.

## Features

### Movie Searching (API Integration)

- Allows users to search for movies by entering a title using the OMDB API to pull the data it is then parsed to a Movie object to handle the data.

### User Friendly 

 - Easy to understand
 - 

### Two Screens - 

This is one area where I definitely feel the app could be improved. 
As it is, the home screen is too bare, but I would love to spend some more time on this and maybe include a "Random Movie" button, which would pull a random title from OMDB. 
I also think there is a lot of room for improvement on the design side of the Home screen, but with more time it would be great to add a carousel of posters from the latest titles.

### Search Results - 

Displayed in list format and scrollable. Poster, Title and Year format is easy to read and understand.

### Loading  - 

Features a loading spinner while data is fetching to show the users progress is being made.

### Error Handling - 

Error messages if no movie is found. With more time I would maybe have it cycle through movie quotes so it fits more with the theme of the website.
For example "Houston, we have a problem" - followed by the Title of the film, and a brief explanation that the user may try again with a different search.

### Navigation - 

Users can flick between the two screens with ease. Admittedly, they may not want or need to in its current state, but it gives me a good starting point to improve on.

### Testing - 

For the limited amount of time i've had to work on it, I was only really able to test it briefly on Iphone and Ipad simulators - but from what i've seen the Flutter widgets adapt well to different sized screens

## Updates

Next steps - 

- "Random Movie" button on Home screen
- Image Carousel on Home screen
- Movie Quote error messages
- Search Filtering 
- Random movie quote button on main screen - linking to Movie Details page
- Update Icon and App name https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons

## Final Notes

 I made this app by starting off with the default my_first_app and, upon checking the GitHub repository, realised my mistake.

 Finally, if some of the comments on my .dart files seem messy, I apologise but my plan is to improve upon this app and they give me pointers of what to research more into and brief descriptions of features. I have no doubt that as I become more adept programming in this new language, neater and more concise comments will follow.
